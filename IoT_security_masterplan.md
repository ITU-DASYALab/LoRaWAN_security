Idea:

group vulnerabilities / attacks by

horizontal: 4-tier view -   

device  |   gateway  |   netwserver  |   app/data servers  (terms might differ, but quite universal)

vertical: 

type/class of attack  - physical, user/governance, crypto .... (not a stringent system, but good enough)


|                 |   Device    |   Gateway    |   Netw Server    |   App/data Server    |
|                 | :---          |     :---      |        :---  |       :---  |
| physical               | theft    | theft     | ...    |   | 
| physical               | jamming    | jamming     | ...    |   | 
| user/governance | default password    | default password   | ...   | .... |
| user/governance | key provision    | default password   | ...   | key provision |
| cryptography               | weak cryto     | ...     | weak cryto    |   | 



| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |

| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
