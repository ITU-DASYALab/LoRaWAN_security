## Kerlink password procedures


Kerlink gateways such as the iFemtoCell (others?)
have a default password that is made up of its EUI,
which in turn is publicly visible.

Their tech wiki https://wikikerlink.fr/wirnet-ifemtocell/doku.php?id=wirnet-ifemtocell:startup states:

> To prevent Web robots from attacking the gateway with standard login/password “root/root”, default password is built using the last 6 characters of the board ID : pdmk-$serialno. 

Worth a scan for devices left on default?
How to find IPs?
